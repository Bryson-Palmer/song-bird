Your mobile compendium of songs, lyrics, chords, and other helpful musical information. We created SongBirdie as a way for a modern singer/songwriter to compile their own personal journal. Utilizing SongBirdie allows you to have a digital SongBook wherever you are connected to the internet. We also know your SongBook is a personal item, so when you create an account, only you can view your song information. At SongBirdie you are free to be you - with the flexibility to save your creative inspirations wherever you may be. Perhaps it's a song name, a new lyric, a new set of chords to try - add what you want when you want.
