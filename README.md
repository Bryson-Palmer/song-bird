# SongBirdie‚Ñ¢Ô∏è üé∂
A singer/songwriter's mobile compendium of lyrics, chords, and other helpful musical information.
We created SongBirdie as a way for a modern singer/songwriter to compile their own personal journal.   Utilizing SongBirdie allows you to have a digital SongBook wherever you are connected to the internet.  We also know your SongBook is a personal item, so when you create an account, only you can view your song information.  At SongBirdie you are free to be you - with the fleibility to save your creative inspirations wherever you may be.  Maybe its a song name, maybe its a new lyric, maybe its a new set of chords to try - add what you want when you want.
